Professional Work Experience
Sept 2024– Present: GRM Actuarial Function P&C (GRM-APC), Hannover Re - Germany
• Reserving calculation for different segments using ResQ for quarterly & annual valuation.
• Coordination between GRM-DFA (internal model), RAV-PCV, Pricing & underwriting teams.
• Support special analyses regarding P&C business (e.g. inflation analysis, AvsE analysis)
• Deep-dives on multiple LoB’s using stochastic and ML reserving methods to calculate the
Sharp Internal Estimate, ultimate reserve risk, and one-year reserve risk.
• Support Solvency II reporting and governance processes with respect to P&C business: Fulfill
requirements of Actuarial Function
• Quarterly and annual IFRS17, SII reporting in non-life insurance business.
Sept 2023– Aug 2024: GRM Actuarial Function P&C, Hannover Re – Germany (Master Thesis and Work student)
Master Thesis: Outlier Analysis in Loss Reserving and Sharp Internal Estimate (Grade 1.1)
• Outlier Detection in Loss Triangles: Developed statistical techniques and visualization tools to
identify, categorize, and analyze outliers that distort the predictive accuracy of traditional
methods.
• Impact Assessment of Outliers: Evaluated how anomalies influence loss reserve calculations by
systematically categorizing outliers based on nature and magnitude.
• Exploration of Alternative Reserving Methods: Compared traditional Chain Ladder methods
with alternative deterministic and stochastic approaches to assess their predictive accuracy and
alignment with actual booked values and different Machine Learning reserving techniques.
• Automated Outlier Detection: Proposed semi-automated techniques for identifying outliers,
contributing to enhanced validation and profitability analysis rather than precise reserving.
